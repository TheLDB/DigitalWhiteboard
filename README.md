# What can you do with Digital Whiteboard?
  - Digital Whiteboard is a place to quickly jot down ideas for projects and work out how they're going to work.
  - As a developer, I constantly find myself writing down things so I can understand them better, but I can easily lose them or damage them, not if its digital.
